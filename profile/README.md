`expokits` is an "Open Core" project providing production-grade, "batteries-included" starters for Expo and React Native. [Visit expokit.dev to get your kit](https://expokit.dev/).

## 🚀 Our Philosophy: The "Open Core" Factory

`expokits` is built around a matrix of tech stacks, helping you skip the repetitive setup and boilerplate.

  * **Base (Free / Open Source):** A perfectly configured starter (e.g., Expo + Tamagui + Drizzle). This is our marketing engine, built in public.
  * **Pro (Paid / Private):** The `Base` version, pre-loaded with complex business logic (e.g., Payments, Team Management, Chat). This is our revenue source.

## Repos (Our "Production Lines")

Our "factory" is organized by product line (SaaS, Social, etc.). Each line has a public `Base` repo (for the community) and a private `Pro` repo (for customers).

  * [expokits/expokit-social](https://github.com/expokits/expokit-social): (Coming Soon) The open-core starter for social, chat, and community apps.
  * [expokits/expokit-docs](https://github.com/expokits/expokit-docs): (Coming Soon) Official documentation for all `expokits` starters and Pro modules.
